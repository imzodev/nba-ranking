# NBA Player Ranking App - Wisdom of Crowds

A Next.js app that aggregates user rankings to create the definitive top 25 NBA players of all time using the wisdom of crowds principle.

## üèÄ What This App Does

Instead of relying on expert opinions or traditional rankings, this app lets **you** and thousands of other users create the ultimate NBA top 25 by averaging everyone's individual rankings.

### The Wisdom of Crowds Approach
- **Individual Input**: Each user provides their personal top 25 NBA players
- **Collective Intelligence**: We average all rankings to find the consensus
- **Dynamic Updates**: Rankings evolve as more people participate
- **Real-time Results**: See how the crowd's wisdom changes over time

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.18.0+

## üìä How It Works

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
