# NBA Ranking App - Development Plan & TODO

This is the **living development document** for building the ultimate NBA wisdom of crowds ranking system. Keep this updated as we progress.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview
**Goal**: Create the definitive NBA top 25 by aggregating thousands of fan rankings using the wisdom of crowds principle.

**Core Principle**: When 10,000+ basketball fans rank their top 25, the average becomes more accurate than any expert panel.

---

## 📋 Current Status
✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Foundation
- Wikipedia data extraction working
- Supabase database populated with 25+ players
- Environment fully configured
- Basic infrastructure ready

## 🎯 Ranking System Design

### How We Create the Ultimate Top 25

#### 1. Vote Collection System
```typescript
// User ranking interface
interface UserRanking {
  sessionId: string;
  rankings: Array<{
    playerName: string;
    rank: number; // 1-25
    timestamp: Date;
  }>;
}
```

#### 2. Wisdom Calculation Algorithm
```typescript
// Aggregate rankings using statistical methods
function calculateWisdomRankings(allRankings: UserRanking[]): PlayerRanking[] {
  const playerScores = {};
  
  // Method 1: Average Rank
  for (const ranking of allRankings) {
    for (const vote of ranking.rankings) {
      playerScores[vote.playerName] = playerScores[vote.playerName] || [];
      playerScores[vote.playerName].push(vote.rank);
    }
  }
  
  // Calculate mean and confidence
  return Object.entries(playerScores).map(([playerName, ranks]) => ({
    playerName,
    averageRank: ranks.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / ranks.length,
    confidence: calculateConfidenceInterval(ranks),
    voteCount: ranks.length
  })).sort((a, b) => a.averageRank - b.averageRank);
}
```

#### 3. Advanced Statistical Methods
- **Median Ranking**: Reduces outlier impact
- **Weighted Voting**: Confidence-based weighting
- **Bayesian Updating**: Prior knowledge integration
- **Time Decay**: Recent votes weighted more heavily

## 🎮 UI/UX Design System

### Drag-and-Drop Ranking Interface
```typescript
// Component structure
interface RankingBoardProps {
  availablePlayers: Player[];
  userRankings: Player[];
  onRankingChange: (rankings: Player[]) => void;
}

// Visual ranking display
interface RankingDisplayProps {
  wisdomRankings: WisdomRanking[];
  userRankings?: UserRanking[];
  confidenceIntervals: ConfidenceInterval[];
}
```

### Visual Components Needed
1. **Player Cards**: Drag-and-drop cards with player info
2. **Ranking Slots**: 25 numbered positions
3. **Real-time Updates**: Live ranking changes
4. **Confidence Visualization**: Uncertainty indicators
5. **Comparison View**: Your ranking vs. crowd wisdom
